# TermyCalc
A simple calculator written with GTK4 and Rust, fun little project to get more acquainted
with both technologies.

## Features
 - Buttons that do nothing
 - Buttons that do very little
 - A very small and weird-looking display

## Building
Build the project with `cargo build`, run it with `cargo run`. It's slow as hell to
start and I don't know why, might just be that I don't have any other GTK4 stuff running
and that it needs to load the libraries.
